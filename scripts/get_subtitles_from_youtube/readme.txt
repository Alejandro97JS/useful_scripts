Script to extract subtitles (just text, English or Spanish) from a YouTube video, 
saving it in a given path.

Configuration:
It is enough to define:
- Id of the video (not the url, but the needed id is inside the url).
- Absolute path to output file name (txt format) (if its directory does not exist, it will be created).
