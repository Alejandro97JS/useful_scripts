Script to download a YouTube video, saving it in a given path.

Configuration:
It is enough to define:
- Id of the video (not the url, but the needed id is inside the url).
- Absolute path to output file name (format does not matter, it will be overriden)
(if its directory does not exist, it will be created)
(if no file name is given and the path is a directory, a default one will be generated)
